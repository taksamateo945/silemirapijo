However, New Zealand won this match by six wickets<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>His best test bowling performance came against Australia at Eden Gardens, Calcutta (now Kolkata) in December 1969. In that match, he took the key wickets of their captain Billy Lawry and Doug Walters. He ended his bowling spell with 7 after conceding 98 runs but couldn’t prevent India’s defeat by ten wickets. One of his most memorable spells came against East Africa on 11 June 1975 during the 1975 ICC World Cup, which coincidentally was India’s first-ever victory in One-day international cricket. While East Africa was batting first, Bedi’s bowling halted their run flow, and at one moment, their batting was having no clue against his bowling. Bedi finished his spell with a record 6 runs and one wicket in 12 overs and helped India to reduce opposition on a score of 120 runs in less than 56 overs.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bishan-Singh-Bowling-in-a-match-against-East-Africa-during-1975-ICC-World-Cup.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-85285 class=wp-caption-text>Bishan Singh Bowling in a match against East Africa during 1975 ICC World Cup</p><p>Bedi opens up in a TV series about the unofficial test with Sri Lanka in 1975 in Nagpur by recalling that,</p><p>“I was captain of the team. We were made to stay in an MLA hostel. It was during the month of December and the winter was at its peak. But only I had warm water coming in my room, and not other players. So I called the secretary of the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) and told him to provide warm water to all players. I told him that people who would be coming in numbers to watch the match will not come to see him but the players. I had an altercation with him and he behaved very rudely. I must have abused him too. It was so bad that after the match ended, they (VCA) did not even book the first-class railway ticket for me and another player. We had to travel sitting in the luggage rack of the general compartment in that cold weather.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/India-team-for-the-unofficial-match-against-the-touring-Sri-Lanka-in-1975.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-85286 class=wp-caption-text>India team for the unofficial match against touring Sri Lanka in 1975. Bedi 2nd from right; standing</p><p>In 1976, he was designated as a captain of the Indian cricket team after replacing Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi. The first time, his team won was against West Indies at Port-Of-Spain in the third test of the 1976-77 series. In this match, India chased down the record target of 406 runs in the fourth inning. India then went on to win the test series against New Zealand by 2-0 at home. However, he could not carry on with his form and suffered tournament defeats against England, Australia, and Pakistan after which he was sacked from the captaincy position and was replaced by Sunil Gavaskar in 1978<strong>. </strong>At that time, he was also playing for his home state, which is Punjab, and then moved to Delhi to play for that state until he got retired in 1981. Besides this, he also played county cricket for Northamptonshire<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Post-retirement, he took up the responsibility of a coach and manager of the Indian cricket team. He was given the inexperienced Indian side, which was led by Mohammad Azharuddin against the host New Zealand. He came to the limelight when he offended the Indian team by signaling them to throw into the Pacific Ocean as a result of their poor performances during that time. India failed to chase the modest target of 150 against the Aussies. He also opposed Azhar’s decision to bat first against England at Lord’s in 1990 and ended on a losing side in a series that ended with 1-0. Bedi however, was sacked from this position after the official statement from the Indian team, which stated that they don’t require any coach or cricket manager. After that, he became the coach of Punjab, Delhi, and Jammu & Kashmir Ranji sides. Under his guidance, Punjab registered their win in the Ranji’s final in 1992-93.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stats></span><strong>Stats</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Some of his most memorable series where he has taken most of his wickets are against Australia in 1969-70 where he took 21 wickets. Against England in 1972-73 where he took 25 wickets. Against West Indies in 1975-76 where he took 18 wickets. Against New Zealand in 1976-77 where he took 22 wickets. Against England in the same year where he took 25 wickets. Against Australia in 1977-78 where he took 31 wickets. In tests, he played 67 matches and took 266 wickets with an average of 28.71. His best test bowling performance came against Australia on 16 December 1977 at WACA, Perth where he took 7 wickets after conceding 98 runs. Overall, he has bowled 3560.4 overs and conceded 7637 runs with an economy rate of 2.14. His most impressive record is against England against whom he has taken 85 wickets in 22 matches. This was followed up by West Indies and then New Zealand. 1976 is the year when he had taken most wickets (48 wickets with an average of 20.00). In ODIs, he has played ten games and taken 7 wickets at an average of 48.57. Overall, he has bowled 98.2 overs and conceded 340 runs with an economy of 3.40. His best ODI bowling performance was registered against Pakistan on 1 October 1978 at Racecourse Ground (now Bugti Stadium) in Quetta, Pakistan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversies></span>Controversies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Vaseline Incident</strong>– During the third test in Madras against England in 1977/78, Bedi charged England’s John Liver that he was using vaseline to polish the ball to get that variable seam movement. However, Bedi was proved wrong when it was found that John Liver was using vaseline as a vaseline terrazzo to keep the sweat away from his eyes. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_8><a href=#>[8]</a></span></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Match Forfeiting incident- </strong>During an international game against Pakistan at Sahiwal in 1978 when Bedi was the captain, he called the on-field batters and conceded the game in protest of their bowler Sarfraz Nawaz bowling four bouncers in an over without being called a wide by the umpire. At that point, India was on a verge of victory when they require 23 runs off 14 balls with eight wickets in hand. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_9><a href=#>[9]</a></span></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Awards_Honours_Achievements></span><strong>Awards,</strong> Honours,<strong> Achievements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Indian Cricketer of the Year in 1967</li></ul><ul><li>Arjuna Award by the Government of India in 1969</li></ul><ul><li>Padma Shri Award by the Government of India in 1970</li></ul><ul><li>CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004</li></ul><ul><li>He was inducted into the Wisden India Hall of Fame in 2015</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Favorites></span>Favorites<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Cricketers: </strong>&nbsp;Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Actress:&nbsp;</strong>Sharmila Tagore</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Singer</strong>: Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=FactsTrivia></span>Facts/Trivia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>His hobbies include reading books and cooking.</li></ul><ul><li>His mentors’ names are Gurpal Singh and Gyan Prakash.</li></ul><ul><li>There was always a personality clash between Bishan Singh Bedi and Sunil Gavaskar on a number of topics. However, they strongly respect each other game. This can easily be assessed from the fact that Bedi named his first-born son by the name of Gavaskar. Bedi’s career came to standstill when Gavaskar was raised as the new captain of the Indian cricket team in 1979. On the other hand, when Bedi became the national selector, Gavaskar was axed from the team. A few years later, in 2007, Bedi named Gavaskar as a ‘destructive influence’ on Indian cricket.&nbsp;<span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_10><a href=#>[10]</a></span> <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bishan-Singh-Bedi-with-Sunil-Gavaskar.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-85284 class=wp-caption-text>Bishan Singh Bedi with Sunil Gavaskar</p></li></ul><ul><li>Bedi is a very generous man who once donated blood in Karachi on Cavalier’s tour in response to a news appeal.

Fiercely competitive, he would challenge the batsman to step out or hit him to a specific target. It was a great sight when he won those battles. I had the privilege of facing him in the nets and it was evident that he was still working on setting up a batsman, and I had to be at my absolute best while facing him.”</p><p>He further added</p><p>“I always had this feeling that he treated me like his son.

He also targetted the Indian Premier League (IPL) and named it ‘Scam’. Further, he told,<br><p>“I don’t want to say anything about IPL. There’s not a bigger scam in India than IPL. Nobody here knows where IPL’s money comes and goes. The second edition of the IPL happened in South Africa, millions of money were taken out of the country without the permission of the Finance Minister.”</p></li><li>Renowned sportswriter Suresh Menon quoted Bedi in a newspaper column as <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_12><a href=#>[12]</a></span><br><p>“If the spin quartet were a group of bank robbers, Prasanna would be the one with the plan, Venkat the one who would draw the map pointing out where the dangers lay and how to get past the cameras, Chandra would be in charge of the explosives. Bedi would be the one with the plans to distract the authorities, tricking them into looking in the wrong place.”</p></li><li>Mike brearely, a former England’s captain narrates Bedi’s bowling as ‘beautiful’ in his book. Further, he adds,<br><p>“It indeed was beautiful. In fact, most left-spinners in the world of cricket would love to imitate the fascinating style of delivery that made Bedi such a popular bowler on the circuit. “It was natural,” Bedi is modest. Few know that he would, with none for company, bowl hours and hours every day to hone his skills in Amritsar as a teenager under the tutelage of his guru Gyan Prakash.”</p></li><li>Bedi is an ardent criticizer of modern-day off-spinner who chuck during bowling including renowned spinners Harbhajan Singh and Muttiah Muralitharan. He criticized them for their bent arm for more than 15-degree as standardized by the ICC and termed Muralitharan as a ‘javelin thrower’. Further, he adds,<br><p>“Murali might complete 1000 wickets in Tests but they would count as mere run-outs in my eye. He is a Sri Lankan bandit closing in on a dream artist called Shane Warne”</p></li><li>He also remarked former Australian coach John Buchanan with comment,<br><p>‘Tell us John, have you made this Australian team great, or have they made you?”</p></li><li>Bedi protested against the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) in December 2020 when they named Feroz Shah Kotla Cricket Stadium in the name of the former union minister Arun Jaitley.
